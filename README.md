# Puzzle

Somebody asked me to create something similar as a job interview question. So created several versions (this is the C# version), going to add latter the Java and 
python versions latter.

What this does it reads a file having the following format

 '#' indicates an filled cell
 ' ' indicates a empty cell
 'X' indicates the player start cell
 'F' indicates the target cell
